# Task 3 â€“ Linear Regression

In this task, I worked on building a simple linear regression model to understand how to predict values using a straight line relationship between features.

## What I Did
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
4. Predicted the output for the test data.
5. Visualized the results by plotting the actual vs predicted values.
6. Displayed the regression equation for better interpretation.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## Key Learnings
- Understood how linear regression works and how coefficients represent feature importance.  
- Learned how to evaluate predictions visually using scatter plots.  
- Practiced deriving the regression equation from model coefficients.

This task helped me get a clear idea of how machine learning models like regression are trained and tested in practice.
